# HW6-HMM

In this assignment, you'll implement the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms (dynamic programming). 


# Assignment

## Overview 

The goal of this assignment is to implement the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

For a helpful refresher on HMMs and the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms you can check out the resources [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf), 
[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/markov-and-hidden-markov-model-3eec42298d75), and [here](https://pieriantraining.com/viterbi-algorithm-implementation-in-python-a-practical-guide/). 





## Tasks and Data 
Please complete the `forward` and `viterbi` functions in the HiddenMarkovModel class. 

We have provided two HMM models (mini_weather_hmm.npz and full_weather_hmm.npz) which explore the relationships between observable weather phenomenon and the temperature outside. Start with the mini_weather_hmm model for testing and debugging. Both include the following arrays:
* `hidden_states`: list of possible hidden states 
* `observation_states`: list of possible observation states 
* `prior_p`: prior probabilities of hidden states (in order given in `hidden_states`) 
* `transition_p`: transition probabilities of hidden states (in order given in `hidden_states`)
* `emission_p`: emission probabilities (`hidden_states` --> `observation_states`)



For both datasets, we also provide input observation sequences and the solution for their best hidden state sequences. 
 * `observation_state_sequence`: observation sequence to test 
* `best_hidden_state_sequence`: correct viterbi hidden state sequence 


Create an HMM class instance for both models and test that your Forward and Viterbi implementation returns the correct probabilities and hidden state sequence for each of the observation sequences.

Within your code, consider the scope of the inputs and how the different parameters of the input data could break the bounds of your implementation.
  * Do your model probabilites add up to the correct values? Is scaling required?
  * How will your model handle zero-probability transitions? 
  * Are the inputs in compatible shapes/sizes which each other? 
  * Any other edge cases you can think of?
  * Ensure that your code accomodates at least 2 possible edge cases. 

Finally, please update your README with a brief description of your methods.

## Methods

### Forward Algorithm
The forward algorithm computes the total probability of an observed sequence given the HMM parameters. It builds an alpha table of shape (T, N) where T is the sequence length and N is the number of hidden states. At each timestep, the probability of being in each hidden state is computed by summing over all possible previous states (weighted by their transition probabilities) and multiplying by the emission probability for the current observation. The final forward probability is the sum of the last row of the alpha table.

### Viterbi Algorithm
The Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of hidden states that produced a given observation sequence. It uses a similar dynamic programming table as the forward algorithm, but instead of summing over previous states it takes the maximum. A backpointer table tracks which previous state gave the max at each step. After filling the table, we traceback from the most probable final state to recover the full best path.

### Edge Cases
Input validation in `__init__` checks that the prior probabilities vector length matches the number of hidden states, that the transition and emission matrices have the correct shapes, and that all probability distributions sum to 1.0 (within floating-point tolerance). Empty observation sequences return 0.0 for forward and an empty list for viterbi.
